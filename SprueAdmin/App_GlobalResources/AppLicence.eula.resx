    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

We may terminate the Service at any time 12 months or more after your Service has been first activated in respect of the Product, by giving you written notice of the same. You recognise and agree that this is reasonable because the price of the Product is calculated on the basis that the Service will only be provided for a limited period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;8.4. Without affecting any other right or remedy available, either party may terminate this EULA with immediate effect by giving written notice to the other party if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;8.4.1. the other party commits a material breach of any term of this EULA which breach is irremediable or (if such breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within a period of 14 days after being notified in writing to do so;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;8.4.2. the other party repeatedly breaches the terms of this EULA in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this EULA;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;8.4.3. the other party suspends or ceases, or threatens to suspend or cease, carrying on all or a substantial part of its business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;8.5. On termination for any reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;8.5.1. all rights granted to you under this EULA shall cease;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;8.5.2. you must immediately cease all activities authorised by this EULA, including your use of the Service;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;8.5.3. you must immediately delete the App from the Device on which it is installed, and immediately destroy all copies of the App and Documents then in your possession, custody or control and (at our request) certify to us that you have done so;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-1"&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc457916699"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;9. Communication between us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc457916701"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc416352709"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;9.1. Any notice given to a party under or in connection with this EULA shall be in writing and shall be delivered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;9.1.1. by email to us at &lt;a href="mailto:support@wi-safeconnect.com"&gt;support@wi-safeconnect.com&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;9.1.2. by email to you at the email address you gave to us at the time when the App was linked to the Product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;9.2. Any notice shall be deemed to have been received on the date the email is sent, provided that the sending party can produce evidence that the email was correctly addressed and that it left its systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;9.3. This clause does not apply to the service of any proceedings or any other documents in any legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-1"&gt;10. Force Majeure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;10.1. A party shall not be in breach of this EULA, nor liable for any failure or delay in performance of any obligations under this EULA (and the time for performance of the obligations shall be extended accordingly) arising from or attributable to acts, events, omissions or accidents beyond its reasonable control ("&lt;strong&gt;Force Majeure Event&lt;/strong&gt;"), including but not limited to any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;10.1.1. acts of God, including but not limited to fire, flood, earthquake, windstorm or other natural disaster;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="level-3"&gt;10.1.10. interruption or failure of utility service, including but not limited to electric power, telecommunications, gas or water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;10.2. If the Force Majeure Event prevails for a continuous period of more than 3 months, either party may terminate the EULA by giving 30 days' written notice to all the other party. On the expiry of this notice period, this EULA will terminate. Such termination shall be without prejudice to the rights of the parties in respect of any breach of this EULA occurring prior to such termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-1"&gt;11. General&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.1. &lt;strong&gt;Entire Agreement. &lt;/strong&gt;This EULA constitutes the entire agreement between us relating to its subject matter and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between us, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.2. &lt;strong&gt;Non-Reliance. &lt;/strong&gt;Each party agrees that it shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this EULA. Each party agrees that it shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in this EULA. Nothing in this document shall exclude or limit any liability for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.3. &lt;strong&gt;Variation. &lt;/strong&gt;No amendment or variation of this EULA shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the parties (or their authorised representatives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.4. &lt;strong&gt;Assignment and other dealings. &lt;/strong&gt;You may not assign, transfer, mortgage, charge, subcontract, declare a trust over or deal in any other manner with any of your rights and obligations under this EULA without our prior written consent (which we may withhold at our absolute discretion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.5. &lt;strong&gt;Waiver. &lt;/strong&gt;No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this EULA or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.6. &lt;strong&gt;Severance &lt;/strong&gt;If any provision or part-provision of this EULA is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this clause shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of this EULA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.7. &lt;strong&gt;Third party rights. &lt;/strong&gt;No person, other than a party to this EULA, shall have any rights under or in connection with this EULA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.8. &lt;strong&gt;Governing law. &lt;/strong&gt;This EULA and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="level-2"&gt;11.9. &lt;strong&gt;Jurisdiction. &lt;/strong&gt;Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this EULA or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).&lt;/p&gt;
